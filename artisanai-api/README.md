## Contributing

We welcome contributions!
Please be mindful of the following guidelines:

### Code style
* Adhere to PEP-8 and you should be fine

### Code quality
We ensure code quality through code linting and testing

* Linting

    We use `ruff` as our linter of choice.
    See `ruff.toml` for the linter settings
    Befure submiting changes, run from the `artisanai-api` directory:
    ```shell
    ruff check .
    ```

* Testing

    Aim for 100% LoC coverage with unit tests.

    E2E testing is done from the frontend application.

    Run unit tests with:
    ```shell
    coverage run -m unittest discover -s tests
    ```

    which generates a coverage report, which you see with:
    ```shell
    coverage report -m
    ```

    Alternatively, run both with:
    ```shell
    coverage run -m unittest discover -s tests; coverage report -m
    ```
